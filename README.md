# Futaba-SBUS2
An Arduino program for connecting my Arduino Uno to my Futaba SBUS2.



# Description
Essentially, I'm using the SoftSerial library to communicate with my Arduino. This will end up on my RC Plane (and maybe my Model Rockets??) so that I can recieve sent telemetry. The original Futaba sensors are extremely expensive and rare. Using an Arduino, I will be able to add as many Temperature Sensors as I like (as an example) and have it sent back to my Futaba via T-FHSS by the SBUS2 protocol. It is still a work in progress and I'm waiting from Futaba regarding the Intellectual property notices as to whether I'm allowed to post this

# Nomenclature
Yes, I know that similar libraries exist, but I really wanted to push the boundaries of me (and my Arduino). Also, I know that I can program (anyone can really), but my code is usually really unoptimised. In this case, optimising my code will be crucial and critical where data needs to be sent quickly and reliably.
